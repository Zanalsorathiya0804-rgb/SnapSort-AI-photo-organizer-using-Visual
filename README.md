# SnapSort – AI-Powered Photo Organizer using Visual Intelligence & DSA (C++ Project)

A professional offline photo-organizing application built fully in **C++** using **OpenCV** and classic **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** like Trie, Union-Find, Graphs, and Sliding Window.

## 🚩 Problem

Most users today have thousands of unorganized photos on their phones or laptops. Common issues include:
- ❌ Duplicate or burst images taking up space
- ❌ No automatic way to create albums based on events or dates
- ❌ Manual sorting and tagging is time-consuming
- ❌ Searching for a photo like “Goa trip 2024” is difficult without structured albums

There is **no lightweight, offline C++ tool** that solves this using intelligent logic and structured algorithms.

## ✅ Solution

**SnapSort** solves this problem by applying advanced image and data structure logic to:
- ✅ Automatically organize photos into **albums** by time and similarity
- ✅ Detect and group **duplicate or burst images**
- ✅ Extract time data and visually hash each image
- ✅ Use **DSA** to intelligently cluster, search, and tag
- ✅ Save results into neat folders like `album_0`, `album_1`, etc.

All this is done **offline**, using pure C++ for performance, and no external cloud or AI models.
